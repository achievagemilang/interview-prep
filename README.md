## 🧠 Algorithm Patterns

Instead of solving problems randomly, I categorize them by **underlying patterns**. This helps in recognizing the correct approach for new, unseen problems.

| Pattern           | Key Concepts                                                | Problem Count | Last Updated |
| :---------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------- | :-----------: | :----------- |
| **Ad Hoc**        | Simulation, Implementation, Math/Logic, Constructive        |      TBA      | Dec 2025     |
| **Two Pointers**  | Collision (Left/Right), Fast & Slow (Floyd's), In-place Ops |      TBA      | Dec 2025     |
| **Binary Search** | Monotonicity, Search Space Reduction, Answer Range          |      TBA      | Dec 2025     |

### 📂 Directory Structure

Note: Each `*.java` has their own comments to visualize my approach.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

These solutions are my own attempts at understanding the problems. While I aim for optimal Time O(n) and Space O(1) complexities, some solutions might be brute-force first iterations.
